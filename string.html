1. : Count Characters
        You are given a string S, and your task is to return an array B (having a size of 2), where B[0] contains the count of haracter A (uppercase) in string S and B[1] contains the count of character D (uppercase) in string S.
        Note: You have to complete countCharacters function. No need to take any input.

        const countCharacters = (S) => {
            let countOfA = 0;
            let countOfD = 0;
            for (let character of S) {
                if (character === "A") {
                    countOfA++;
                } else if (character === "D") {
                    countOfD++;
                }
            }

            return B;
        };

2. : count the Heads
        Tina is given a string  S which contains the first letter of all the student names in her class. She got a curiosity to check how many people have their names starting from the same alphabet. So given a string  S , she decided to write a code that finds out the count of characters that occur more than once in the string.

        var Count_Occ = (s) => {
        let newString = "";
        let letters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
        let count = 0;
        for (let letter of letters) {
            for (let character of s) {
            if (letter === character) {
                count++;
            }
            }
            if (count > 1) {
            newString += `${letter}${count}`;
            }
            count = 0;
        }
        return newString;
        };

        var Count_Vowels = (S) => {
        let vowels = "aeiou";
        let count = 0;
        for (letter of vowels) {
            for (character of S) {
            if (letter === character) {
                count++;
            }
            }
        }
        return count;
        };

4. : Concatenate the Strings
        You are given two strings S1 and S2 (containing both uppercase and lowercase letters), You need to retrun a string which is the concatenation of both the given strings.

        var Concatenate_Strings = (S1, S2) => {
        return S1.concat(S2);
        };

5. Find Length
        You are given a string S, and your task is to return the length of the string S.
        Note: You have to solve it without using length method. You have to complete findLength function. No need to take any input.

        const findLength = (S) => {
        let count = 0;
        for (let letter of S) {
            count++;
        }
        return count;
        };

6. : Find the Winner
        You are given a string S consisting of two letters A and D,where each character represent the winner of N games played between Aditya and Danish, where letter A represents the win of Aditya and letter D represents the win of Danish.
        You need to find out the that which player wins the maximum number of games or there is a draw between them.
        Note: You have to complete Game_Winner function. No need to take any input.

        var Game_Winner = (S) => {
        let countOfA = 0;
        let countOfD = 0;
        for (let letter of S) {
            if (letter === "A") {
            countOfA++;
            } else {
            countOfD++;
            }
        }

        if (countOfA > countOfD) {
            return "Aditya";
        } else if (countOfA < countOfD) {
            return "Danish";
        } else {
            return "Draw";
        }
        };

        */

        const joinStrings = (S, P) => {
        return S.concat(P);
        };

8. : Palindrome Check
        You are given a string S, Your task is to check wether the given string is a Palindrome or not.A Palindrome is a string, which turnout same when read in reverse direction.
        Example: "naman" is a Palindrome.
        String can contain both upppercase lowercase letters.
        Note: You have to complete Plain_Check function. No need to take any input.

        var Palin_Check = (str) => {
        let reversedString = "";
        for (let i = str.length-1; i >= 0; i--) {
            reversedString += str[i];
        }

        if (str === reversedString) {
            return "True";
        } else {
            return "False";
        }
        };

9. : Reverse the String
        You are given a string S, Your task is to Reverse the string.
        String can contain both upppercase lowercase letters. 
        Note: You have to complete Reverse_String function. No need to take any input.

        var Reverse_String = (str) => {
        let reverseString = "";
        let length = str.length;

        while (length > 0) {
            reverseString += str[length - 1];
            length--;
        }

        //! Time exceeded.
        //   for (let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i++) {
        //     reverseString += str[i];
        //   }

        return reverseString;
        };

10 . : Match the Strings
        You are given two strings S1 and S2, Your task is to print YES if both strings are same else print NO.
        Note: You have to complete String_Match function. No need to take any input.

        var String_Match = (S1, S2) => {
        return S1 === S2 ? "YES" : "NO";
        };
